Deadline: Tuesday, November 9th

The announcement for the homework is in [announcement.md](announcement.md).

Installation instructions can be found here [https://spinroot.com/spin/Man/README.html](https://spinroot.com/spin/Man/README.html).

I personally installed it by cloning the [official Github repo](https://github.com/nimble-code/Spin) and then running `make; sudo cp Src/spin /usr/local/bin`. 
To check that your installation is working you can run `spin -V`.
